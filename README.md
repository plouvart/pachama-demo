# Quick Assessment of the deforestation of Pacaj치 Par치 via Sentinel-2 #

This repository hosts a notebook I wrote yesterday to assess how well Pachama does in its mission to **preserve the forest in Pacaj치 Par치** using Sentinel-2 data.

It is a really **rough** estimation making exclusively use of the **SCL** (Scene CLassification) band of the S2 L2A product.
The main purpose of this exercice is just for me to have fun exploring the subject of the amazonian forest and its preservation.

To install the environment required to run the notebook yourself, I suggest you install poetry and issue the following command at the root of the project
```bash
poetry install
```
then select the venv created as kernel.

at the root of the project.

Please note this uses Python 3.10!

A render of this notebook (made with quarto-cli) can be viewed on my personal website [here](https://lambdakey.org/custom-html/pachama_demo.html)!
